Within this folder are files pertaining to Cerulean hybrid assembly of the pink berry dataset. 

Cerulean has lots of dependencies, so we made a machine image with Amazon Web Services to keep track of all these programs.
The "AMI-setup" files describe this challenging setup. In the future, it would be nice to better organize an AMI, as all
programs are installed in the home directory.

Two assembly attempts were made. A first attempt was with a subset of the metagenomic dataset, just binned to bacteroidetes. 
This was unsuccessful and abandoned. After a few months of trying to let go of our frustrations, we attempted to assemble the 
entire metagenome.
