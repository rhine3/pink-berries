* Completed a hybrid assembly using:
    * Long reads: /home/rhine3/data/metagenomes/sequence_reads/pacbio/corrected.fastq
    * Short reads: /home/rhine3/data/metagenomes/sequence_reads/illumina_4pacbio/Lizzy9.fastq
    * Results directory: /home/qbio18/assembled_hybrid_12ppn
 * Attempted (unsucessfully) a hybrid assembly of Pacbio reads and all Illumina/Moleculo reads. Requested 1 node, 12 ppn, 64 GB total. Got an error message saying that it ran out of memory (194GB needed).
