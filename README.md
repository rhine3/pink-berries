# pink-berries

This repository was used to store and exchange work relating to a study of the Pink Berry metagenomic dataset.

First attempts at a hybrid assembly were made by Tessa Rhinehart using the Cerulean program (see files within `cerulean-old/`). This involved creating an Amazon Web Services AMI to load all of Cerulean's dependencies. Unfortunately, Cerulean is no longer maintained, and ultimately this project was abandoned in favor of attempting other pipelines.

This project was brought to the Santa Barbara Advanced School of Quantitative Biology at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. Lizzy Wilbanks oversaw the project. Students were Arantxa Urchuegu√≠a Fornes, Connie Ha, Matt Melissa, and Michael Pearce. Tessa Rhinehart and David Tian assisted with the students while conducting their own analyses on this and other datasets.
