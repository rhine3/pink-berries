# pink-berries

This guide details efforts to create a hybrid assembly of Lizzy Wilbanks's Pink Berry dataset. 

First attempts were by Tessa Rhinehart using the Cerulean program (see files within `cerulean/`). This involved creating an Amazon Web Services AMI to load all the dependencies of the program. Unfortunately, Cerulean is no longer maintained, and ultimately this project was abandoned in favor for attempting other programs.

This project was brought to the Santa Barbara Advanced School of Quantitative Biology at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. Lizzy Wilbanks oversaw this project, with Tessa Rhinehart and David Tian serving as TAs. Students were 
Arantxa Urchuegu√≠a Fornes, Connie Ha, Matt Melissa, and Michael Pearce.
